erously. Understand the original intent may be different than
your interpretation in a different time, medium, format, and
context.
In the process of creating this book, I may have mistakenly
re-contextualized, misinterpreted, or misunderstood things.
As content passed through time, space, and medium, some
phrasing may have shifted in flight. Every effort has been made
to maintain the original intent, but errors are (very) possible.
Interviews have been transcribed, edited, rearranged, and
re-edited for readability. I did my best to keep Naval’s ideas
in his own words.
All brilliance in this book is Naval’s; any mistakes are mine.
TWEETS AND TWEETSTORMS
Tweets are formatted like pull quotes but are unique content.
I use them to summarize or punctuate an idea from the main
prose.
This formatting shows I’m quoting a tweet.
Tweetstorms are connected tweets, formatted like this:
10 · THE ALMANACK OF NAVAL RAVIKANT

This is the first tweet in a tweetstorm.
↓
This is the second tweet. Tweetstorms are longer series of
tweets all threaded together, similar to a blog post.
BOLDED QUESTIONS
Many excerpts are from interviews by fantastic creators like
Shane Parrish, Sarah Lacy, Joe Rogan, and Tim Ferriss. The
questions are bolded. For simplicity and continuity, I do not
distinguish various interviewers from each other.
NON-NARRATIVE
This is a choose-your-own adventure book. Jump to anything
that interests you and skip anything that doesn’t.
LOOK IT UP
If you find a word or concept you’re not familiar with, look it
up. Or, read on to find more context. Some referenced ideas
are expanded upon later in the book.
CITATIONS
Citations (like [1]) indicate the end of an excerpt. I’ve done my
best to maintain context for smooth reading. Sources are in
the appendix for reference. Some sources appear many times
and do not appear in order.

I hope this acts as an introduction to Naval’s ideas. I’ve col-
lected his most powerful and useful ideas in his own words,
woven them into a readable thread, and organized those into
sections for easy reference.
I often find myself reviewing sections of this book before
making an investment or opening to the Happiness chapter if
I’m feeling off. Creating this book has changed me. I feel more
clarity, confidence, and peace through all aspects of life. I hope
reading it will do the same for you.
The Almanack is intended as a guide to be read and consulted
for specific topics. If Naval doesn’t answer your emails, I hope
this book gives you the next-best advice.
This book is an introduction to Naval and dives deeply into his
two most-explored topics: wealth and happiness. If you want
to continue exploring Naval and his other ideas, I encourage
you to check out the “Next on Naval” section at the end of this
book. I’ve shared chapters that were edited out of the final
book, as well as other popular resources.
Be well,
Eric

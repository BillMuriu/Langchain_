BACKGROUND
I grew up in a single-parent household with my mom working,
going to school, and raising my brother and me as latchkey
kids. We were very self-sufficient from a very early age. There
was a lot of hardship, but everyone goes through hardship. It
did help me in a number of ways.
We were poor immigrants. My dad came to the US—he was a
pharmacist in India. But his degree wasn’t accepted here, so
he worked in a hardware store. Not a great upbringing, you
know. My family split up. [47]
My mother uniquely provided, against the background of hard-
ship, unconditional and unfailing love. If you have nothing
in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you
unconditionally, it’ll do wonders for your self-esteem. [8]
We were in a part of New York City that isn’t very safe. Basically,
the library was my after-school center. After I came back from
school, I would just go straight to the library and hang out
there until they closed. Then, I would come home. That was
my daily routine. [8]
We moved to the US when we were very young. I didn’t have
many friends, so I wasn’t very confident. I spent a lot of time
reading. My only real friends were books. Books make for great
friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand
years tell you their nuggets of wisdom. [8]
My first job was with an illegal catering company in the back
of a van delivering Indian food when I was fifteen. Even when
I was younger, I had a paper route and I washed dishes in the
cafeteria.

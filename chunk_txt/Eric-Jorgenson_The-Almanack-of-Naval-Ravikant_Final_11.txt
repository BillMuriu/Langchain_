How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):
↓
Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets
that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time
and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
↓
Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly
despise wealth, it will elude you.
↓
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by
attacking people playing wealth creation games.
↓
You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must
own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial
freedom.
↓
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not
yet know how to get. At scale.

Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with
long-term people.
↓
The internet has massively broadened the possible space of
careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.
↓
Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth,
relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
↓
Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and,
above all, integrity.
↓
Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are
self-fulfilling.
↓
Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be
unstoppable.

Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and
leverage.
↓
Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for.
If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace
you.
↓
Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine
curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
↓
Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will
look like work to others.
↓
When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through
apprenticeships, not schools.
↓
Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It
cannot be outsourced or automated.

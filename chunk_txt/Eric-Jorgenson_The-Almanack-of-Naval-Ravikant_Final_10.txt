UNDERSTAND HOW WEALTH IS CREATED
I like to think that if I lost all my money and you dropped me
on a random street in any English-speaking country, within
five or ten years I’d be wealthy again because it’s just a skillset
I’ve developed that anyone can develop. [78]
It’s not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant
eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting
rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when
to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard
work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But
it has to be directed in the right way.
If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most
important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a
lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be work-
ing on.
I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for
myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen.
I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve
been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I
got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out
the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and
capture some of that created wealth.
This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of
course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an
hour’s worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good
starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense,
very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the informa-
tion and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard
over ten years, you’ll get what you want. [77]

Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your
own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity,
and leverage.

“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will
move the earth.”
—Archimedes

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from
capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of
replication (code and media).
↓
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific
knowledge with accountability and show resulting good
judgment.
↓
Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most
fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress
your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.

Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is
chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone
is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
↓
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the
leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and
media that works for you while you sleep.

An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data
centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
↓
If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and
podcasts.
↓
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.
↓
Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by
learning foundational skills.

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines
and business classes.
↓
Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion,
ethics, mathematics, and computers.
↓
Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.
↓
You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an
uncluttered calendar.
↓
Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If
fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore
it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate,
outsource it.
↓
Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with
and what you work on are more important than how hard
you work.

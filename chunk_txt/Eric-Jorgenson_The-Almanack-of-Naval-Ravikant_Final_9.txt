I was a totally unknown kid in New York City from a nothing
family, an “immigrants trying to survive” situation. Then, I
passed the test to get into Stuyvesant High School. That saved
my life, because once I had the Stuyvesant brand, I got into an
Ivy League college, which led me into tech. Stuyvesant is one
of those intelligence lottery situations where you can break in
with instant validation. You go from being blue collar to white
collar in one move. [73]
At Dartmouth, I studied economics and computer science.
There was a time when I thought I was going to be a PhD in
economics. [8]
Today, I’m an investor, personally, in about two hundred com-
panies. Advisor to a bunch. I’m on a bunch of boards. I’m also
a small partner in a cryptocurrency fund because I’m really
into the potential of cryptocurrencies. I’m always cooking up
something new. I always have a bunch of side projects. [4]
All that, of course, in addition to being the founder and chair-
man of AngelList. [4]
I was born poor and miserable. I’m now pretty well-off, and
I’m very happy. I worked at those.
I’ve learned a few things, and some principles. I try to lay them
out in a timeless manner, where you can figure it out for your-
self. Because at the end of the day, I can’t quite teach anything.
I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks so you
can remember. [77]
